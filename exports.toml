# exports.toml — Single source of truth for Rust-to-Python exports.
#
# Every symbol registered in src/python/mod.rs::register_module() must
# appear here.  The CI test validates both directions:
#   1. Every manifest entry is importable from `rapid_textrank`
#   2. Every non-underscore symbol in `rapid_textrank._rust` is in the manifest
#
# Format:  name = {}                           (always present)
#          name = { feature = "feature-name" }  (feature-gated)
